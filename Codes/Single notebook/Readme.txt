Please read these instructions before running the files
The files:
- 1 Web scraping.ipynb
- 2 Content based filtering.ipynb
- 3 Collaborative filtering.ipynb

These are the files using which the project has been created and should be uploaded and run on Google cola for testing.

IMPORTANT:
However, we have compiled all the project and you only need to run the Main file. Ipynb to get the output. Therefore, just run the Main file.ipynb in your Jupiter notebook and everything would run on its own.

Thank you.
